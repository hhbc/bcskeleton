Welcome to BCSkeleton Drupal theme

Description
-----------
BCSkeleton is a Drupal 7 subtheme of the Skeleton theme
(http://drupal.org/project/skeletontheme) and depends for
now on version 7.x-1.1 (as time of this writing version
7.x-1.2 is out but untested as there are some new features
in there).

INSTALLATION:
-------------
1. Place the entire bcskeleton directory into your Drupal 
   
   sites/all/themes/ 
   
   directory.
   (Because of being a subtheme take care that the skeletontheme
   is also inside this directory.) 

2. Enable the bcskeleton theme by navigating to:
   
   admin/appearance
   
   and set the theme to enabled / default theme. (Notice:
   the skeletontheme may or may not be enabled.)
